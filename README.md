I never released this project, more of me just playing around with net code, I was able to sync player movement across clients, send messages in a a chat, and allow players to host their own severs that others would join with codes like most indie multiplayer games, but I didn't have the knowledge at the time to sync physics simulations between clients and ended up scrapping the idea.
